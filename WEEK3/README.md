## Welcome to Week 3
Welcome to the third week of our Machine Learning Course! This week, we'll dive into the world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image preprocessing using OpenCV. We'll explore foundational concepts of CNNs, emphasizing image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, blurring, and noise removal using OpenCV. Through practical exercises on various datasets, we'll enhance our understanding and skills in building and training CNN models.

Stay engaged and practice consistently to make the most of this learning experience. Keep your enthusiasm high, and letâ€™s continue this exciting journey of machine learning together!

1) Let's start with [OpenCV](https://github.com/wncc/Machine-Learning-LS-24/tree/main/Week%203/Image%20Preprocessing%20-%20OpenCV), essential for preprocessing the raw image data.
2) Now it's time to explore [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/wncc/Machine-Learning-LS-24/tree/main/Week%203/CNN), the most efficient NN to deal with image data.
3) Let's put our knowledge to the test and tackle the [Assignments]().
