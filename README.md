# WIDS--FaceCipher
This project is focused on exploring and implementing various techniques in image processing, object detection, and facial recognition. Over the course of four weeks, the project leverages different models and frameworks to develop a robust system for facial recognition and analysis.
1. [WEEK 1](WEEK1) : Python Modules - Linear and Logistic Regression
2. [WEEK 2]() : TensorFlow/PyTorch - Neural Networks and YOLOv8
3. [WEEK 3]() : OpenCV and CNN for Image Processing
4. [WEEK 4]() : Siamese Neural Networks - Face Recognition


You should start your work at the earliest each week so that you have ample time to complete assignments by the end of the week. This approach will help you manage your tasks effectively and ensure that you meet deadlines without feeling rushed.
