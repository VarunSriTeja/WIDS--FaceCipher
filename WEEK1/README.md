# Welcome to Week 1
Welcome to the first week of our Journey! This week, we’ll start by equipping ourselves with essential ML libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are crucial for data manipulation and visualization. Following this, we’ll delve into the foundational concepts of machine learning, including regression.
While certain topics may not be directly incorporated into the final project, they enhance my understanding of machine learning concepts and offer significant experience in the field of computer vision.

1. We will begin with a brief revision of [Python](https://scrimba.com/learn/python) fundamentals to ensure everyone is on the same page.(You may skip this section if you are already familiar with Python)
2. We'll cover [ML Libaries / Python Modules](https://github.com/VarunSriTeja/WIDS--FaceCipher/tree/main/WEEK1/Python%20Modules)to facilitate efficient data manipulation and visualization.
3. Our first ML concept will be [Linear Regression](https://github.com/VarunSriTeja/WIDS--FaceCipher/tree/main/WEEK1/Linear%20Regression), a powerful technique for modeling relationships between variables.
4. Next, we'll explore [Logistic Regression](), a fundamental method for binary classification tasks.

# End of Week 1
It's time to put our knowledge to the test. Let's tackle the [Assignments](https://github.com/VarunSriTeja/WIDS--FaceCipher/tree/main/WEEK1/Assignment1) and practice our skills to reinforce our understanding.
